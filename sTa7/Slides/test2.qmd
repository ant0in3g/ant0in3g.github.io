## Disjoint Events (= Mutually Exclusive Events)

Disjoint (mutually exclusive) events cannot be both true.

- Tossing a coin once, the events $\{$ getting H$\}$ and $\{$ getting T$\}$ are disjoint
- The events \{John passed STAT 220\} and \{John failed STAT 220\} are disjoint
- Drawing a card from a deck, the events \{getting an ace\} and \{getting a queen\} are disjoint


## Disjoint Events (= Mutually Exclusive Events)

Disjoint (mutually exclusive) events cannot be both true.

- Tossing a coin once, the events $\{$ getting H$\}$ and $\{$ getting T$\}$ are disjoint
- The events \{John passed STAT 220\} and \{John failed STAT 220\} are disjoint
- Drawing a card from a deck, the events \{getting an ace\} and \{getting a queen\} are disjoint

Non-disjoint events can be both true.

- The events \{John got an A in STATs\} and \{John got an A in Econ\} are NOT disjoint

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\text { jack or red }) & =P(\text { jack })+P(\text { red })-P(\text { jack and red }) \\
& =\frac{4}{52}+\frac{26}{52}-\frac{2}{52}=\frac{28}{52}
\end{aligned}
$$

## General Addition Rule

$$
P(A \text { or } B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \text { and } B)
$$

For disjoint events $P(A$ and $B)=0$, so the above formula simplifies to

$$
P(A \text { or } B)=P(A)+P(B)
$$

## The Complement Rule

## The Complement Rule

- Because an event must either occur or not occur,

$$
P(A)+P\left(A^{c}\right)=1
$$

- Thus, if we know the probability of an event, we can always determine the probability of its complement:

$$
P\left(A^{c}\right)=1-P(A)
$$

- This simple but useful rule is called the complement rule


## Example - The Complement Rule

Question: What is the probability of getting at least one head in 3 tosses of a fair coin?

- Sample space

$$
S=\{H H H, H H T, H T H, T H H, H T T, T H T, T T H, T T T\}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Event } A & =\{\text { at least one heads }\} \\
& =\{H H H, H H T, H T H, T H H, H T T, T H T, T T H\}
\end{aligned}
$$

- $A^{c}=\{$ not least one heads $\}$

S=\{H H H, H H T, H T H, T H H, H T T, T H T, T T H, T T T\}

\begin{aligned}
\text { Event } A & =\{\text { at least one heads }\} \\
& =\{H H H, H H T, H T H, T H H, H T T, T H T, T T H\}
\end{aligned}
$$

- $A^{c}=\{$ not least one heads $\}=\{$ all tails $\}=\{T T T\}$
- $P\left(A^{c}\right)=$

& =\{H H H, H H T, H T H, T H H, H T T, T H T, T T H\}
\end{aligned}
$$

- $A^{c}=\{$ not least one heads $\}=\{$ all tails $\}=\{T T T\}$
- $P\left(A^{c}\right)=1 / 8$

## Conditional Probability

## Conditional Probabilities

## Example - Poker

A card is drawn from a well-shuffled deck.
-What is the probability that the card drawn is a King?

$$
P(\text { got a King })=\frac{4}{52}=\frac{1}{13} .
$$

- If the card drawn is known to be a face card ( $J, Q, K$ ), what is the probability that it is a $K$ ?


## Conditional Probabilities

A card is drawn from a well-shuffled deck.
-What is the probability that the card drawn is a King?

$$
P(\text { got a King })=\frac{4}{52}=\frac{1}{13} .
$$

- If the card drawn is known to be a face card ( $J, Q, K$ ), what is the probability that it is a $K$ ?

$$
\frac{4}{12}=\frac{1}{4}
$$

## Conditional Probabilities

Given two events $A$ and $B$. We denote the probability of event $A$ happens given that event $B$ is known to happen as

$$
P(A \mid B),
$$

read as the probability of " $A$ given $B$."
For the example on the previous slide, let

$$
\begin{aligned}
& A=\text { the card is a King, } \\
& B=\text { the card is a face card }(\mathrm{J}, \mathrm{Q}, \mathrm{~K}) .
\end{aligned}
$$

We have

$$
P(A \mid B)=\frac{4}{12} \neq P(A)=\frac{4}{52}
$$

Current knowledge (face card) has changed (restricted) the sample space (possible outcomes).

## Exercise

In the previous example, what is
$P\left(B \mid A^{c}\right)=P($ the card is a face card $\mid$ the card is not a King $) ?$

## Exercise

In the previous example, what is
$P\left(B \mid A^{c}\right)=P$ (the card is a face card | the card is not a King)?

- If the card is not a King, as there are 4 Kings in a deck, then the card must be one of the remaining 48, among which 8 are face cards ( 4 Jacks and 4 Queens). So the answer is 8/48.

$P($ full prof. | under 40$)=\frac{P(\text { full prof. \& under } 40)}{P(\text { under } 40)}=\frac{0.046}{0.404}$


## General Multiplication Rule

## General Multiplication Rule

The formula for conditional probability

$$
P(B \mid A)=\frac{P(A \text { and } B)}{P(A)}
$$

can be used the other way around. Multiplied both sides by $P(A)$, we get the General Multiplication Rule:

$$
P(A \text { and } B)=P(A) \times P(B \mid A)
$$

If we want $P(A$ and $B)$, and both $P(A), P(B \mid A)$ are known or are easy to compute, we can use the General Multiplication Rule.

## Practice - Checking for Independence

Between January 9-12, 2013, SurveyUSA interviewed a random sample of 500 NC residents asking them whether they think widespread gun ownership protects law abiding citizens from crime, or makes society more dangerous. $58 \%$ of all respondents said it protects citizens. $67 \%$ of White respondents, $28 \%$ of Black respondents, and $64 \%$ of Hispanic respondents shared this view. Are opinion on gun ownership and race ethnicity independent?

## Independence of Events v.s. Independence of Variables in a Two-Way Contingency Table

Recall that for a two-way contingency table, the two variables are independent if the row proportions do not change from row to row. This is consistent with the definition of independence of events since

$$
\text { row proportions }=P \text { (column var.|row var.), }
$$

and if the row proportions do not change from row to row, they will be equal to the marginal prob. of the column variable.

$$
P\left(A_{1} \text { and } \cdots \text { and } A_{k}\right)=P\left(A_{1}\right) \times \cdots \times P\left(A_{k}\right)

True or False and explain: $0.134 \times 0.52 \approx 7 \%$ of the U.S. population were males age 65 or older.

False, age and gender are dependent.
In particular, as women on average live longer than men, there are more old women than old men.

Among those age 65 or older, only $44 \%$ are male, not $52 \%$. Of the U.S. population in 2012, only $0.134 \times 0.44 \approx 5.9 \%$ were males age 65 or older.

## Example - Nervous Job Applicant

Suppose an applicant for a job has been invited for an interview.
The probability that

- he is nervous is $P(N)=0.7$,
- the interview is successful given he is nervous is $P(S \mid N)=0.2$,
- the interview is successful given he is not nervous is $P\left(S \mid N^{c}\right)=0.9$.

What is the probability that the interview is successful?

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(S) & =P(S \text { and } N)+P\left(S \text { and } N^{c}\right) \\
& =P(N) P(S \mid N)+P\left(N^{c}\right) P\left(S \mid N^{c}\right) \\
& =0.7 \times 0.2+0.3 \times 0.9=0.41

Conversely, given the interview is successful, what is the probability that the job applicant is nervous during the interview?

What is the probability that the tested person is infected if the test was positive?

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(D \mid T+) & =\frac{P(D) P(T+\mid D)}{P(D) P(T+\mid D)+P\left(D^{c}\right) P\left(T+\mid D^{c}\right)} \\
& =\frac{(1 / 300) \times 0.98}{(1 / 300) \times 0.98+(299 / 300) \times 0.005} \\
& =39.4 \%
\end{aligned}
$$

This test is not confirmatory. Need to confirm by a second test.

Law of Large Numbers

## Law of Large Numbers

Law of large numbers states that as more observations are collected, the proportion of occurrences with a particular outcome, converges to the probability of that outcome.

## Misunderstanding of Law of Large Numbers I

When tossing a fair coin, if heads comes up on each of the first 10 tosses, what do you think the chance is that another head will come up on the next toss? 0.5 , less than 0.5 , or more than 0.5 ?

- The probability is still 0.5 , or there is still a $50 \%$ chance that another head will come up on the next toss.

$$
P\left(H \text { on } 11^{\text {th }} \text { toss }\right)=P\left(T \text { on } 11^{\text {th }} \text { toss }\right)=0.5

- The coin is not "due" for a tail.

- The coin is not "due" for a tail.
- The common misunderstanding of the LLN is that random processes are supposed to compensate for whatever happened in the past; this is just not true and is also called gambler's fallacy


## Misunderstanding of Law of Large Numbers II

Let
$H(n)=\#$ of heads obtained in $n$ tosses of a fair coin.
Generally, we say LLN says that " $H(n) \approx \frac{n}{2}$."
What does " $H(n) \approx \frac{n}{2}$ " mean precisely?

- Does $\left|H(n)-\frac{n}{2}\right| \longrightarrow 0$ as $n$ gets large?
- Does $\left|\frac{H(n)}{n}-\frac{1}{2}\right| \longrightarrow 0$ as $n$ gets large?

See Lab 4 and HW3.
