## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both

$$\int_0^1 \sin(x) \ dx$$

content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).



```{r}
mixite_groupe_edf <- read.csv("data_raw/mixite-dans-le-groupe-edf.csv",sep = ";")
```


```{r}
library(readxl)
salaire <- read_excel("data_raw/mrsd_2022Wages_table4.xlsx", sheet = "T4", range = "B10:J352", col_names = {
  c("SSOC 2020","Occupation","Number Covered","Basic Wage - 25th Percentile ($)", "Basic Wage - Median  ($)","Basic Wage - 75th Percentile ($)","Gross Wage - 25th Percentile ($)", "Gross Wage - Median  ($)","Gross Wage - 75th Percentile ($)")})
```
